Exercise 4 - 
================================================================

If you already know Visual Studio and how to create a C# project you can move on to the next exercise otherwise the steps below will outline how to create a project and add the needed references for using Selenium WebDriver. 
You are going to create a folder where all your work from these exercises will be saved

1. Creating a Solution for the Exercises
----------------------------------------
In these lessons we will use this one solution to hold and build all exercises.

.. sidebar:: Notes

  Solutions are containers used to organize one or more related projects and there compilation. 
  When you open a solution in Visual Studio, it automatically loads all the projects it contains.

+ Open Visual Studio
+ In the top menu Select: ``File`` > ``New`` > ``Project``
+ In the left tree Select: ``Other Project Types`` > ``Visual Studio Solutions``
+ Select the project type ``Blank Solution``
    + Type "WebDriverViaCSharp" in the ``Name`` textbox 
    + Change the location to where you want them stored
    + Click ``Ok`` button
+ Now save the project by clicking the ``Save All`` icon, or (Ctrl+Shift+S)

So now you should have a new solution called: **"WebDriverViaCSharp"**
